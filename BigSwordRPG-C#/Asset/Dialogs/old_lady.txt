Hello Adventurer ! I am happy to meet you, I heard a lot of good coming from you.
I am the guardian of the forest, I am the one who watches over the balance of the forest and the animals that live there. 
Recently, the balance of the forest has been disturbed by the arrival of a new group of robots. These robots are very aggressive and are attacking the animals of the forest. I need your help to restore the balance of the forest.
Beat the robots in the forest and bring me their pieces, hopefully we can end this torment.
